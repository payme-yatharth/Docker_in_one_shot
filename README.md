**Part one :** 


**problems statment :**   replicating multiple environments and configurations while working in a team and collaboration and same problem is with the configurations when deploying the environment and the configuration on the cloud. so to replicate the same config and env everywhere for the project to work we use the docker and we therefore dockerise the projects.

we make containers in docker for solving this as we make container for an application for a service with a uniform configuration to be run on every other machine whether local or deploying on the cloud too. Containerization simply helps in that project setup and deployment.
